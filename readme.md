# Embedded ARM â€” PowerOn to main()

We will build a simple embedded program using Linker Script, Assembly and C to initialize the microcontroller and hand over to C main() program. 

The udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-baremetal-scheduler-a-rtos-functionality/ covers until blimking LEDs, creating terminal user interface using UART and a scheduling algorithm for running multiple tasks. 

The details upto main() C function is in blog https://medium.com/@malaydasat/embedded-arm-poweron-to-main-d81fca36ca7f and described on youtube https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQQmMGmejomcjZTyE0gAuOF-6rIfAqXCS
